Virtual Run 90Kilo is a mobile application that has the function to follow an event of various types of sports.

## Introduction what is VRITB90

The Virtual Run 90Kilo with a distance of 90 kilometers or 30 kilometers
was organized by the ITB alumni running community batch 90,
90lerun, to invite long-distance running lovers among alumni to keep
active and exercise during this pandemic. The 90-kilometer distance
was chosen for the 90th Army and the 30-kilometer distance for the
30-year Batch 90 IITB. Participants can take it individually in 30
days with several submissions. Running can be done alone or together
with fellow runners while upholding strict health protocols. So that it helps strengthen the ties of friendship among ITB alumni batch
90. The social concept was also carried out at the 90Kiloan Run to raise study funds
for the sons and daughters of ITB alumni batch 90 who had preceded us.
A new Flutter project.


## Getting Started

```sh
Most of the code on this project is slicing. Some features are not available on this Flutter project.
```

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more function in the near future.  Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this app!
